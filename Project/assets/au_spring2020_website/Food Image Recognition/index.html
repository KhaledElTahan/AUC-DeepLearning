		<p>
			Our main problem here is automatic food recognition. Food is an important part of our everyday life. It got into digital life by the richness of  photography in social media and dedicated photo sharing sites. This implies that automatic recognition of Food would not only help users effortlessly organize their extensive photo collections but would also help online photo repositories make their content more accessible. Additionally, food journal apps are now used to help patients estimate and track their daily caloric intake to modify their food habits and maintain a healthy diet. However, Current food journaling applications such as MyFitnessPal App require users to enter their meal information manually. Some people found that to be time consuming.

	For the Food-101 dataset: the state-of-the-art model for this dataset used the following:
 </p>
<ul>
		  <li>Assembling techniques into ResNet-50.</li>
		  <li>They applied network tweaks such as ResNet-D, SK, Anti-alias, DropBlock, andBigLittleNet to ResNet. In more detail, ResNet-D and SK apply to all blocks in all stages. 
</li>
		  <li>Downsampling with anti-aliasing only applies to the downsampling block from Stage 2 to Stage 4. Drop-Block only applies to all blocks in Stage 3 and Stage 4. Little-Branchfrom BigLittleNet uses one residual block with smaller width.
</li>

The dataset was newly released so there weren't any proposed models on it except the one on the original paper. They used one of the most famous network architectures for image recognition to be their baseline. The model was using ResNet-101 architecture.

    	</div>
		<h5 class="mt-5">Second proposed model is using AutoEncoder to create a Food Embedding.</h5>
		<p>
			An embedding is a relatively low-dimensional space into which we can translate high-dimensional vectors. Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs like sparse vectors representing images. Ideally, an embedding captures some of the semantics of the input by placing semantically similar inputs close together in the embedding space. An embedding can be learned and reused across models.

Image Embedding is very important for imagesâ€™ classification because these correspond to a huge dimension data (e.g. a 20 megapixel camera picture with 3 RGB layers means 60 millions of integers as the total info stored in the image), So we can use the Embedding as input of the model, containing a reduced dimensionality but with much semantic information.

we will use a AutoEncoder (AE) to create a Food Embedding. This information can be used in ML algorithms with higher semantic quality and similarity between Foods.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Results</h2>

        <p>
			For the AutoEncoder Model:
From comparing the results between using the full dataset and only a sample of 6000, we can see that the validation loss is less. Maybe this will indicate a better generalization. This is predicted as the dataset is a lot more than 6000. The real performance of the embeddings can only be seen and compared in real applications or used in different ML problems that we can measure accuracy and other metrics. We can for example, use it in clustering the same food categories or recognition of the food category based on its similarities between each other.

	    <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h2>

	    <p>
			Conclusion:
The dataset has lots of images and classes. It can be discovered in many ways. We tried to use it at first to solve the problem of food recognition, but we didnâ€™t manage to get any helpful results. On the other hand, this made us see another perspective that we can use the data for another purpose. At last, we managed to see that even with no computational power, we can produce new ideas to get use of different datasets. 
Future work :
Variational AutoEncoder can be used and see if it can achieve better performance than AutoEncoder.Those embeddings can be used in different ML algorithms with higher semantic quality and similarity between Food categories.
Finally, deep learning is a powerful tool, you can get use of it in discovering new data and information that you can learn from a single dataset. Training may need computational power but getting a creative ideas to get use of datasets doesnâ€™t.
