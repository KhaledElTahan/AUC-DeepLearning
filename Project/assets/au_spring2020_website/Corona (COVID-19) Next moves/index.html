		<p>
      Since the December 2019 outbreak of the #coronavirus (COVD-19) in China, we all
have been closely watching the news and listening to speeches about the deadly
virus. There is panic everywhere with people wearing masks and others locked in
their houses all day to avoid contracting the virus. The disease has
<li>  Killed more than 2,800 people </li>
<li>  Infected more than 84,000 (2nd March, 2020 statistics) </li>

In this proposed project we are using Machine learning & Deep learning to
indicate the next moves of the COVID-19 that it will take for the next months, may
be years, and how the trends of this virus will affect the world’s population and
economy.

        <p>
          <h5> Content </h5>
    2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC

    This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

    The data is available from 22 Jan, 2020.

  <h5> Column Description </h5>
    Main file in this dataset is covid_19_data.csv and the detailed descriptions are below.

    covid_19_data.csv

    Sno - Serial number
    ObservationDate - Date of the observation in MM/DD/YYYY
    Province/State - Province or state of the observation (Could be empty when missing)
    Country/Region - Country of observation
    Last Update - Time in UTC at which the row is updated for the given province or country. (Not standardised and so please clean before using it)
    Confirmed - Cumulative number of confirmed cases till that date
    Deaths - Cumulative number of of deaths till that date
    Recovered - Cumulative number of recovered cases till that date

        <p>
			My project inputs were the outputs of previous levels each time (cases), to predict the new cases.
      And the model was divided to Decoder, and encoder:
      <h5> Decoder </h5>
      y(t) = LSTM(s(t-1), y(t-1)); where s is the hidden state of the LSTM(h and c)
      y(0) = LSTM(s0, C); C is the context vector from the encoder.
      <h5> Encoder </h5>
      X = Input sequence
      C = LSTM(X); The context vector

        <h2 class="mt-5">State of the art</h2>

        <p>
          In our project we are trying to predict the number of cases of corona virus as time
          passes, we will do this by the use of deep learning (ofcourse) ,and specifically by
          the help of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long short term memory as they
          perform well in the forecasting activity.
          This approach is expected to do very well but will also contain some errors like:
          <li> Forecast errors </li>
          A forecast “error” is the difference between an observed value and its forecast.
          Here “error” does not mean a mistake, it means the unpredictable part of an
          observation
          <li> Scale-dependent errors </li>
          The two most commonly used scale-dependent measures are based on the
          absolute errors or squared errors
          <li> Percentage errors </li>
          Percentage errors have the advantage of being unit-free, and so are
          frequently used to compare forecast performances between data sets
          <li> Scaled errors </li>
          And ofcourse we will use the methods described below to have more accurate
          results		</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Orignial Model from Literature</h2>

        <p>
        <h5>  Description </h5>
          We used RNN models with LSTM or GRU cells for better
          performance, preferably with encoders and decoders. We will agree on the
          design of the LSTM (encoders and decoders) when we have more
          information about it, but initially:
          <li> Encoder: LSTM (input) </li>
        <li>  Decoder: LSTM (input state -1) </li>
        <h5>  Reason we selected this </h5>
          In general RNNs work well with prediction problems as it keeps the history
          into account to be able to forecast the upcoming event or pattern.		</p>

        <p>
			Add all the model updates you made here, need as many images as you wish
		</p>

		<h5 class="mt-5">Update #1: Used Repeat vectors</h5>
		<p>
		 In our project, the RepeatVector layer repeats the incoming inputs a specific number of time. The shape of the input in the project example was ( 32 , ).
     But the output shape of the RepeatVector was ( 3 , 32 ), since the inputs were repeated 3 time

    	<br/> <!-- Empty Line after the image -->

		<h5 class="mt-5">Update #2: Used time distributed layer</h5>
		<p>
      This wrapper allows to apply a layer to every temporal slice of an input. The input should be at least 3D, and the dimension of index one will be considered to be the temporal dimension.

TimeDistributed layer applies a specific layer such as Dense to every sample it receives as an input. Suppose the input size is ( 13 , 10 , 6 ). Now, I need to apply a Dense layer to every slice of shape ( 10 , 6 ). Then I would wrap the Dense layer in a TimeDistributed layer.

model.add( TimeDistributed( Dense( 12 , input_shape=( 10 , 6 ) )) )
