# Labs

## Opening the labs in Google Colaboratory

The labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.

On this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run (lab1, lab2, lab3, lab4, lab5) and open the appropriate python notebook (*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

## Running the labs

Now, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the "Runtime" tab --> "Change runtime type". In the pop-up window, under "Runtime type" select "Python 3", and under "Hardware accelerator" select "GPU". Go through the notebooks and fill in the #TODO cells to get the code to compile for yourself!
